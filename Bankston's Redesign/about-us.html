      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
      <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        The Bankston family has been in business for over 40 years. Rodney and
        Kay Bankston started Bankston Tire and Appliance in the early 70's.<br />
        The business flourished under their leadership and when their sons Brent
        and Brad started to show interest in business they knew that they had<br />
        the beginning of something unique. With the Tire and Appliance store
        still in full swing, Rodney realized that if anything was to ever
        "happen" to him,<br />
        that a mother and two children could not continue to run the existing
        business. So in the early eighties as the boys got older and showed
        interest<br />
        collecting, a natural business started to evolve. In 1985, Bankston's
        Used books was opened with a small comic and sports card selection in
        the<br />
        store. Mostly hardback and paperback books at the time. Meanwhile the
        collectible industry was poised to explode as both comic books and<br />
        baseball cards started to blossom. Brent and Brad fervently enjoyed the
        business and applied the same, character driven "customer-first"<br />
        attitude they were taught at the Tire and Appliance store to the their
        new business. Now, all these years later, we have Bankston's<br />
        Sports Cards & Comics as well as Austin Books & Comics that staff
        good,friendly, knowledgeable people to continue on the tradition<br />
        started all those years ago by Rodney and Kay Bankston.
